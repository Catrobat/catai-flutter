# CatAI : LLM-Based AI Programming Support for Catrobat Applications

CatAI is an innovative project that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 into the Catrobat platform to provide powerful AI-driven programming support for users. With CatAI, you can expect a wide range of features and capabilities to make your Catrobat app development experience smoother, more efficient, and more enjoyable.


## Project Overview
CatAI is designed to assist Catrobat app developers by leveraging advanced language models to offer the following types of support:

* **Code Generation:** Automatically generate code from text prompts or descriptions, helping developers quickly implement desired features.
* **Error Correction:** Identify and suggest fixes for common coding errors or issues, improving code quality and reducing debugging time.
* **Code Architecture Recommendations:** Provide guidance on designing and structuring code, including suggesting optimal architectures and meaningful variable names.
* **Project Ideas:** Generate creative project ideas based on your input and preferences.
* **Code Explanation:** Provide detailed explanations for downloaded code snippets, helping you understand and modify code shared by others.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community to enhance CatAI's capabilities and expand its support for Catrobat developers. 

If you want to contribute we suggest that you start with forking the repository and browse the code. Then you can look at our [Issue-Tracker](https://jira.catrob.at/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=60) and start with fixing one ticket. We strictly use [Test-Driven Development](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment) and [Clean Code](http://www.planetgeek.ch/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Clean-Code-V2.2.pdf), so first read everything you can about these development methods. Code developed in a different style will not be accepted. After you've created a pull request we will review your code and do a full testrun on your branch.

Also make sure to read our guidelines for [creating a pull request](https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroid/wiki/Creating-a-pull-request)
